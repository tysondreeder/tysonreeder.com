From versions 1\u20133.1 we had a list of components and code examples, but this left the door too open and we noticed inconsistencies in what was being created using it. We decided we needed something more going forward. We needed a Digital Design\u00a0System.<\/p><p>In late 2017 a group was put together to work on building out the Digital Design System. The team consisted of a Product Owner, a lead designer that was also an Interaction Designer, two developers and two visual designers.

Reeder","content:encoded":"<p>On May 15th 2017 Mutual of Omaha was set to launch a brand new marketing campaign. Complete with a television commercial, billboards, digital ads and radio ads the campaign was set to be pretty large. Along with the campaign there was to be a new corporate website with an improved IA and a new look and feel on top of existing content. In July of 2016 I was appointed as lead Visual Designer on the project and in August 2016 we kicked off the\u00a0project.<\/p><p>From a visual and interaction standpoint I had a few things I wanted to make sure were addressed in the redesign. So I worked with the team to set some design principles.<\/p><ol><li>We wanted to reduce the color palette and use color only where necessary. With a focus on high contrast to ensure readability since we were targeting an older demographic.<\/li><li>We wanted clear calls to action and better button hierarchy.<\/li><li>We wanted to design in a way that would meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA ADA requirements.<\/li><li>We wanted to freshen the brand and stand out among competitors.<\/li><\/ol><p>When we began the project Mutualofomaha.com looked like the image below. We were suffering from an identity crisis. We had our work cut out for\u00a0us.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*ujqBBDl0UwSycANMKSoPxQ.jpeg\" \/><figcaption>Screenshots of different pages on Mutualofomaha.com before the May 15th redesign.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>We started by conducting stakeholder interviews and due to timing restrictions it was decided by leadership that we would not have time to interview customers. Even though this was not how my team would of liked things to work out, we pivoted and created proto-personas to help inform decisions.<\/p><p>After we had an idea of who we were building the site for and the stakeholder vision we started working on the information architecture. For this we leaned heavily on an IA specialist at the agency. We met with her and worked through the IA which we used to inform the wireframes.<\/p><p>We tested different versions of wireframes and navigation with customers.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*gdeWerBfGf76QY5-wc6zWw.png\" \/><figcaption>Example of wireframe that was\u00a0tested<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Once the wireframe for the homepage was established we moved to interior\u00a0pages.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*nyRJ9KINHYNxAXtibuyJcQ.gif\" \/><figcaption>Initial wireframes for interior\u00a0pages.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>This is where things got hairy. We were told the scope of the project was existing content with a new visual presentation and some updated navigation and\u00a0IA.<\/p><p>It was becoming apparent that this might be a problem so we raised the concern and kept moving\u00a0on.<\/p><p>Up until this point there hadn\u2019t been much talk of what the new look and feel for the brand was going to be. It had been communicated to us that the commercial would drive the new branding. I quickly realized that we could not wait for the commercial and that we needed to figure out the feel of the brand as soon as possible to be able to move forward. So we got together with the agency and after a little back and forth we landed on a decision right around Christmas.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*S-u8VejNvEcscKMTPEg2VQ.png\" \/><figcaption>Please disregard the broken text styles on the\u00a0buttons.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Now that we had a brand guideline we needed to get homepage mockups ready for presentation to the C-level leadership. We worked with the agency to come up with three concepts to\u00a0present.<\/p><p>Ultimately we landed on these. Two concepts that were a blend of our design ideas (first two)and one that just my team put together (far\u00a0right):<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*b1hb9mvcnhQMKMF5TzyPSw.png\" \/><figcaption>Three homepage concepts.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>If you go to mutualofomaha.com today I bet you can tell which one won. It was the first\u00a0one.<\/p><p>From there my team focused on creating internal product pages. We wanted to create templates for the pages so that we could maintain consistency across the site. When trying to do this with the existing content we realized that it was going to clutter the site and that content needed to be discarded and some new content would need to be\u00a0written.<\/p><p>Due to the short deadline we had to move through product sections fast to get them to states for approval.<\/p><p>We knew traditional ways of moving work through the company for approval would not cut it. If we were going to move through sections fast we needed to get everyone in a room and handle concerns right then and\u00a0there.<\/p><p>So we started the new workflow. At the beginning of the week we would provide writing templates to the writers for 4 products. We would then take the content they wrote and apply it in the template around the middle of the week. Then towards the end of the week we would have a \u201cpizza party\u201d where we would invite stakeholders, product and compliance into a large room to review the pages. We would handle any easy changes in that meeting and make sure concerns were handled. Then we would finish up getting the sections ready for state approval and send them on their way. The next week the cycle would start over until we got through all the products.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*Uk1XOrg9bpv4irT1fgfR6g.png\" \/><figcaption>Example of Product Basics\u00a0template<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*9Pxm1DZ8mpOY0TtaXeQGAw.png\" \/><\/figure><p>It was fast passed and there was never a dull moment, but it is what made the redesign such a\u00a0success.<\/p><p>Once product sections were done we moved on to the other sections of the site. We enlisted Primacy to help us build out some of these sections.<\/p><p>As we were designing pages the developers were building them. We all colocated into a room on the lower level and the team grew substantially. We had many long hours and many problems to solve on the fly, but we hit the deadline and launched the site with very few\u00a0bugs.<\/p><p>You can see the end product of all that work here: mutualofomaha.com<\/p><h3>Roles on this\u00a0project<\/h3><p>Visual Designer, Front-End Developer<\/p><img src=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/_\/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=defe19730943\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/tyson-reeders-case-studies\/mutual-of-omaha-com-redesign-defe19730943\">Mutual of Omaha.com Redesign<\/a> was originally published in <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/tyson-reeders-case-studies\">Tyson Reeder\u2019s Case Studies<\/a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.<\/p>","atom:updated":"2018-02-14T04:52:22.632Z","title":"Mutual of Omaha.com Redesign","link":"https:\/\/medium.com\/tyson-reeders-case-studies\/mutual-of-omaha-com-redesign-defe19730943?source=rss----89e86fc4845---4","guid":{"@isPermaLink":"false","$":"https:\/\/medium.com\/p\/defe19730943"},"category":["ux","design-process","redesign","design"],"pubDate":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 04:52:22 GMT"},{"dc:creator":"Tyson D.

I joined the team and played the roles of Visual Designer, Interaction Designer and Front-End Developer.<\/p><p>We conducted stakeholder and user interviews. From there we developed a persona and scenario to work\u00a0towards.<\/p><p>A few key things emerged as very important for both stakeholders and users<br>1. The tool had to house up-to-date and reliable information. This was very important because in the past users found it hard to trust the data that was being distributed to them.<br>2. The tool needed to be mobile friendly.<br>3. It needed to help make quick, informed business decisions.<br>4. The tool needed to get them to what they wanted to\u00a0quick.<\/p><p>We set out to build the tool they\u00a0needed.<\/p><h4>The polished\u00a0design<\/h4><p>We tested some rough prototypes with the user which helped polish our design idea. I took this information and designed the interface.<\/p><p>I wanted to give the user a snapshot of how things were running and let them dive in from there. I hoped to show goals in a very visual way to let them quickly know where they stood. Also I felt it was very important for them to understand the time period of the\u00a0data.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*JiSmTlFjMbL5QHtlDp0xYw.png\" \/><\/figure><p><em>Release 1\u20131.2 happened before I was a part of the\u00a0project<\/em><\/p><h4>Release 2<\/h4><p>Since I was brought on later rather than earlier, a lot of the database structure had already been built. So I did what I could to implement the initial design in the short time\u00a0frame.<\/p><p>The user could pick between a few dashboards to see high level information pertaining to that constraint.

With this release we removed this confusion and created one filter button, something I had suggested at the beginning of the project. The name \u201ccompare\u201d did not seem to resonate with the users so I renamed it to \u201cBreakdown Numbers\u201d a phrase that many had said during our testing. I continued to polish the design and test with users. We also broke this functionality out into its own\u00a0button.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*l9XZbSeAjhOBLnIabkjTyA.png\" \/><\/figure><h4>Release 3.1 (in-progress)<\/h4><p>Our next release will add the ability to edit reports, add new role reports and restructure the way we display our\u00a0data.<\/p><p>I have been testing the latest release with our users and there is a lot of excitement around it. We learned that, while we gave them tools to do what they needed to in previous releases, they would have to invest some time and play around with which filters to add and how they should manipulate the data. <strong>This was something the majority would not do<\/strong>. So we adjusted.<\/p><p>We talked with some key users to learn what is the data that can help them do their job better. There was a lot of overlap between people and roles so we started building steps to quickly get them to this\u00a0data.<\/p><p>We created a set of reports with the focus of seeing how a broker is running with Mutual of\u00a0Omaha.<\/p><p>Here is that interaction:<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*7NwlxB2EzILKRk8IWYspAw.jpeg\" \/><figcaption>After selecting the \u201cBroker Overview\u201d we just need to know the broker they are interested in learning more\u00a0about<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*7V5R2pGPeZ6QFV8Zk8vJVg.jpeg\" \/><figcaption>They are then presented with a screen that gives them a high level understanding of the\u00a0broker<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*B5mIanoTrHwjV53XX_gvXQ.jpeg\" \/><figcaption>From there they can drilldown into the information and we show them what they are looking for at each\u00a0stage.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>By talking with the users we were able to understand what they need when they need it. The broker overview was created because many times they just want to be able to see how a specific broker is running. Instead of making them think of how to filter down to this data we just ask them one question and we handle the rest. These reports along with saving of customized reports are some of the most valuable additions we have made to the application for our\u00a0users.<\/p><p>I joined the project in April of 2014 and since then usage has been steady. We have many users checking the application frequently and returning often. I will be leaving the project by the end of September, but the team has a strong framework to build upon. Overall, I would say the project has been a success and a great learning experience for all involved.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*As8zcoFeeL7aD7_-Ac80nQ.png\" \/><figcaption>Analytics for the different releases.
