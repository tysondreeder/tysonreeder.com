  <p>When the redesigned Mutualofomaha.com was initially launched there were no sticky navigation elements. Below is a GIF that recreates what the site looked like when it was release in May of 2017.</p>
</div>

<div class="gif-container">

</div>

<div class="content-container">
  <p>We decided to tackle this problem in phases. First we made the main navigation sticky when the user scrolled.</p>
</div>

<div class="gif-container">
    <img src="/images/sticky-global-nav.gif" />
</div>

<div class="content-container">
  <p>But I wanted to spend some time on the secondary navigation. I felt we needed to also make the subnav stick to the top of the page to allow the user to quickly navigate between sections of the product. So, I started working on how we could accomplish this.  Some things I had to keep in mind:</p>

  <p>
      <ul>
          <li>The contact information on the right would need to remain prominent and easy to access.</li>
          <li>Sometimes we use this same area to the right to show the agent’s photo and contact information. So the new design would need to support this functionality.</li>
          <li>I wanted to avoid hiding navigation items as much as possible.</li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Some of my initial ideas:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="/images/sticky-nav-designs.png" />
    <p>Exploration for the sticky subnav.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-container">
    <p>While I liked the idea of keeping the contact buttons exposed on the mobile device I knew we would run into a problem because of state regulation. In some states we are not allowed to call our agents <q>agents</q>. So there was a potential for <q>Contact an Authorized Representative</q> to be the CTA so we would run out of real estate quickly.</p>
    <p>Ultimately I came up with the following design and worked with a developer to get it built.</p>
